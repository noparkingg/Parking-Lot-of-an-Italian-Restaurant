# Parking Lot of an Italian Restaurant 
#### Lab Section 1020
#### Group Members: James Sanchioli & Shivangi Tiwari
### Program Function
Our program will ask the user for their name and favorite recipe. 
The program will also confirm if the user is allowed to use cutlery. 

### Why did we make our License and Code of Conduct as they are?
Great question! We made our license generic because The Parking Lot of an Italian Restaurant LLC would like to be credited when our program is used, but we do not care if others use our program. We are not responsible for those who use our program and anything they make of it.
